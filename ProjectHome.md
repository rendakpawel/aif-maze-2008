Welcome to the Maze project!

This project was developed for the Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals course at Warsaw University of Technology, MiNI faculty, Computer Science major.

It is a 2 person project developed by ≈Åukasz Barcikowski and Pawel Rendak using Java Technology.

Project is now in final state and maybe some day will be upgraded or further developed, but no one know when that may happen :)

On the right you can find available downloads, summarized in Download section (tab above).

Dist package contains executable files necessary to simply launch the application and see how it works. It also contains javadoc for the project.

Src package contains simply project sources. (.java files)

Eclipse package contains everything everything along with some eclipse specific project files that allow to launch project in eclipse as it was developed :)

Project itself is aimed at generating and solving mazes. It is rather simple, it generates a maze of desired size using so called stack based approach, and solves it using right hand rule, optimizing it for dead ends.

Enjoy :)
